# Soundness TUI

A WebAssembly-based Terminal User Interface (TUI) for submitting proofs to the Soundness testnet. Built with Rust, Yew, and wasm-pack, this application allows users to generate keys, import mnemonic phrases, list keys, and send proofs interactively.

## About

This project is designed to interact with the Soundness testnet API (`https://testnet.soundness.xyz/api/proof`) for proof submission. Itâ€™s currently in development, with a focus on simplifying the proof-sending process via a web-based interface.
